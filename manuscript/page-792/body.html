"GHOST To D. JOHN.—Behold their dreadful fates, and know that thy
last moment's come!
"D. JOHN.—Think not to fright me, foolish ghost; I'll break your
marble body in pieces and pull down your horse.
        (Thunder and lightning—chorus of devils, etc.)
"D. JOHN.—These things I see with wonder, but no fear.
Were all the elements to be confounded,
And shuffled all into their former chaos;
Were seas of sulphur flaming round about me,
And all mankind roaring within those fires,
I could not fear, or feel the least remorse.
To the last instant I would dare thy power.
Here I stand firm, and all thy threats contemn.
Thy murderer (to the ghost of one whom he had murdered)
Stands here! Now do thy worst!"
        (He is swallowed up in a cloud of fire.)</p></blockquote></div> </div>
