  The bridal of the earth and sky,
  The dew shall weep thy fall to-night;
      For thou must die.
  Sweet rose, whose hue angry and brave
  Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye
  Thy root is ever in its grave,
      And thou must die.
  Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,
  A box, where sweets compacted lie
  My music shews, ye have your closes,
      And all must die.
       THE BOSOM SIN:</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
