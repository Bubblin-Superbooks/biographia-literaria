  So lived he, until his eightieth year was past.
  And grossly that man errs, who should suppose
  That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,
  Were things indifferent to the Shepherd's thoughts.
  Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed
  The common air; the hills, which he so oft
  Had climbed with vigorous steps; which had impressed
  So many incidents upon his mind
  Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;
  Which, like a book, preserved the memory
  Of the dumb animals, whom he had saved,
  Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts,
  So grateful in themselves, the certainty
  Of honourable gain; these fields, these hills
  Which were his living Being, even more
  Than his own bloodâ€”what could they less? had laid
  Strong hold on his affections, were to him
  A pleasurable feeling of blind love,
  The pleasure which there is in life itself.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
