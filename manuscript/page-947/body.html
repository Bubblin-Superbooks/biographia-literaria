[ —</p><blockquote><p>   ———"The big round tears
   Cours'd one another down his innocent nose
   In piteous chase,"
says Shakespeare of a wounded stag hanging its head over a stream: naturally, from the position of the head, and most beautifully, from the association of the preceding image, of the chase, in which "the poor sequester'd stag from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt." In the supposed position of Bertram, the metaphor, if not false, loses all the propriety of the original.]</p></blockquote></div> </div>
