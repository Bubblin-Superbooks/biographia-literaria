<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">aloud I cry:
  I, I, I! I itself I!
  The form and the substance, the what and the why,
  The when and the where, and the low and the high,
  The inside and outside, the earth and the sky,
  I, you and he, and he, you and I,
  All souls and all bodies are I itself I!
                All I itself I!
                (Fools! a truce with this starting!)
                All my I! all my I!
  He's a heretic dog who but adds Betty Martin!
  Thus cried the God with high imperial tone;
  In robe of stiffest state, that scoffed at beauty,
  A pronoun-verb imperative he shoneâ€”
  Then substantive and plural-singular grown
  He thus spake on! Behold in I alone
  (For ethics boast a syntax of their own)
  Or if in ye, yet as I doth depute ye,
  In O! I, you, the vocative of duty!
  I of the world's whole Lexicon the root!
  Of the whole universe of touch, sound, sight
  The genitive and ablative to boot:
  The accusative of wrong, the nominative of right,
  And in all cases the case absolute!
