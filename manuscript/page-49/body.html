<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">contrasting the duration of his works with that of his personal existence, Shakespeare adds:</p><blockquote><p>  Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
  Tho' I once gone to all the world must die;
  The earth can yield me but a common grave,
  When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
  Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;
  And tongues to be your being shall rehearse,
  When all the breathers of this world are dead:
  You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen,
  Where breath most breathes, e'en in the mouth of men.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
