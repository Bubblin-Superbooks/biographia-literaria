   This wretched woman thither goes;
   And she is known to every star,
   And every wind that blows
   And there, beside the Thorn, she sits,
   When the blue day-light's in the skies,
   And when the whirlwind's on the hill,
   Or frosty air is keen and still,
   And to herself she cries,
   Oh misery! Oh misery!
   Oh woe is me! Oh misery!"
and compare this with the language of ordinary men; or with that which I can conceive at all likely to proceed, in real life, from such a narrator, as is supposed in the note to the poem; compare it either in the succession of the images or of the sentences; I am reminded</blockquote></div> </div>
