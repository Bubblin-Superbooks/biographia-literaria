         Short ends of threds,
               And narrow shreds
                    Of lists,
               Knots, snarled ruffs,
                    Loose broken tufts
                        Of twists,</code></pre>
<p>  Are my torn meditations ragged clothing,
  Which, wound and woven, shape a suit for nothing:
  One while I think, and then I am in pain
  To think how to unthink</blockquote></div> </div>
