<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">old age
   Is beautiful and free!
   But we are pressed by heavy laws;
   And often glad no more,
   We wear a face of joy, because
   We have been glad of yore.
   If there is one, who need bemoan
   His kindred laid in earth,
   The household hearts that were his own,
   It is the man of mirth.
   My days, my Friend, are almost gone,
   My life has been approved,
   And many love me; but by none
   Am I enough beloved;"
or the sonnet on Buonaparte, page 202, vol. II. or finally (for a volume would scarce suffice to exhaust the instances,) the last stanza of the poem on the withered Celandine, vol. II. p. 312.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>  "To be a Prodigal's Favorite—then, worse truth,
   A Miser's Pensioner—behold our lot!
   O Man! That from thy fair and shining youth
   Age might but take the things Youth needed not."</p></blockquote></div> </div>
