  Lamented Jack! and here his malt he pil'd,
  Cautious in vain! these rats, that squeak so wild,
  Squeak not unconscious of their father's guilt.
  Did he not see her gleaming thro' the glade!
  Belike 'twas she, the maiden all forlorn.
  What the she milk no cow with crumpled horn,
  Yet, aye she haunts the dale where erst she stray'd:
  And aye, beside her stalks her amorous knight
  Still on his thighs their wonted brogues are worn,
  And thro' those brogues, still tatter'd and betorn,
  His hindward charms gleam an unearthly white.
  Ah! thus thro' broken clouds at night's high noon
  Peeps to fair fragments forth the full-orb'd harvest-moon!</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The following anecdote will not be wholly out of</p></div> </div>
