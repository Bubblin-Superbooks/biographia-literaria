The latter is a riddle of words; the former an enigma of thoughts. The one reminds me of an odd passage in Drayton's IDEAS</p><blockquote><p>  As other men, so I myself do muse,
  Why in this sort I wrest invention so;
  And why these giddy metaphors I use,
  Leaving the path the greater part do go;
  I will resolve you: I am lunatic! </p></blockquote><p>The other recalls a still odder passage in THE SYNAGOGUE: or THE SHADOW OF THE TEMPLE, a connected series of poems in imitation of Herbert's TEMPLE, and, in some editions, annexed to it.</p></div> </div>
