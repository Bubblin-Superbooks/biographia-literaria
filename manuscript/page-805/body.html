   Or the Elysian dreams of lovers when they loved."</p></blockquote><p>Which last sentence must be supposed to mean; when they were present, and making love to each other.—Then, if this portrait could speak, it would "acquit the faith of womankind."

   Which has the better bargain?"</p></blockquote></div> </div>
