<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">right across the verdant sod,
   Towards the very house of God;
   Comes gliding in with lovely gleam,
   Comes gliding in serene and slow,
   Soft and silent as a dream.
   A solitary Doe!
   White she is as lily of June,
   And beauteous as the silver moon
   When out of sight the clouds are driven
   And she is left alone in heaven!
   Or like a ship some gentle day
   In sunshine sailing far away
   A glittering ship that hath the plain
   Of ocean for her own domain."
      \     \     \     \     \     <br>  "What harmonious pensive changes
   Wait upon her as she ranges
   Round and through this Pile of state
   Overthrown and desolate!
   Now a step or two her way
   Is through space of open day,
   Where the enamoured sunny light
   Brightens her that was so bright;
   Now doth a delicate shadow fall,
   Falls upon her like a breath,
   From some lofty arch or wall,
   As she passes underneath."</p></blockquote></div> </div>
