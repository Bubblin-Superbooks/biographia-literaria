<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>  From you have I been absent in the spring,
  When proud-pied April drest in all its trim,
  Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing;
  That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
  Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
  Could make me any summer's story tell,
  Or from their proud lap pluck them, where they grew
  Nor did I wonder at the lilies white,
  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
  They were, tho' sweet, but figures of delight,
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
  Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,
  As with your shadow, I with these did play!"</p></blockquote><p>Scarcely less sure, or if a less valuable, not less indispensable mark</p></div> </div>
