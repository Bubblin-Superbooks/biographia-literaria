    Bodies to spirit by sublimation strange,
  As fire converts to fire the things it burns,
    As we our food into our nature change.
  From their gross matter she abstracts their forms,
    And draws a kind of quintessence from things;
  Which to her proper nature she transforms
    To bear them light on her celestial wings.
  Thus does she, when from individual states
    She doth abstract the universal kinds;
  Which then re-clothed in divers names and fates
    Steal access through the senses to our minds.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Good Sense is the Body of poetic genius, Fancy its Drapery, Motion its Life, and Imagination the Soul that is everywhere, and in each; and forms all into one graceful and intelligent whole.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
