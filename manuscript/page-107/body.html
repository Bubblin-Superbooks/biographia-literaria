  All day the floods a deepening murmur pour;
  The sky is veiled, and every cheerful sight
  Dark is the region as with coming night;
  Yet what a sudden burst of overpowering light!
  Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,
  Glances the fire-clad eagle's wheeling form;
  Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine
  The wood-crowned cliffs that o'er the lake recline;
  Those Eastern cliffs a hundred streams unfold,
  At once to pillars turned that flame with gold;
  Behind his sail the peasant strives to shun
  The west, that burns like one dilated sun,
  Where in a mighty crucible expire
  The mountains, glowing hot, like coals of fire.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
