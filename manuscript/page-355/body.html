<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Thesis V</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Such a principle cannot be any THING or OBJECT. Each thing is what it is in consequence of some other thing. An infinite, independent  thing, is no less a contradiction, than an infinite circle or a sideless triangle. Besides a thing is that, which is capable of being an object which itself is not the sole percipient. But an object is inconceivable without a subject as its antithesis. Omne perceptum percipientem supponit.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But neither can the principle be found in a subject as a subject, contra-distinguished from an object: for unicuique percipienti aliquid objicitur perceptum. It is to be found therefore neither in object nor subject</p></div> </div>
