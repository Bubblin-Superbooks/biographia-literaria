They Give Away A Great Deal Of Money; Find Rich Dowries For Young Men And Maidens Who Have All Other Good Qualities; They Brow-beat Lords, Baronets, And Justices Of The Peace, (For They Are As Bold As Hector!)â€”they Rescue Stage Coaches At The Instant They Are Falling Down Precipices; Carry Away Infants In The Sight Of Opposing Armies; And Some Of Our Performers Act A Muscular Able-bodied Man To Such Perfection, That Our Dramatic Poets, Who Always Have The Actors In Their Eye, Seldom Fail To Make Their Favourite Male Character As Strong As Samson. And Then They Take Such Prodigious Leaps!! And What Is Done On The Stage Is More Striking Even Than What Is Acted. I Once Remember Such A Deafening Explosion, That I Could Not Hear A Word Of The Play For Half An Act After It: And A Little Real Gunpowder Being Set Fire To At The Same Time, And Smelt By All The Spectators, The Naturalness Of The Scene Was Quite Astonishing!</h4></div> </div>
