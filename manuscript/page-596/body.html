<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">diagram, line by line, for a long geometrical proposition. It seems to be like taking the pieces of a dissected map out of its box. We first look at one part, and then at another, then join and dove-tail them; and when the successive acts of attention have been completed, there is a retrogressive effort of mind to behold it as a whole. The poet should paint to the imagination, not to the fancy; and I know no happier case to exemplify the distinction between these two faculties. Master-pieces of the former mode of poetic painting abound in the writings of Milton, for example:</p><blockquote class="  "><p>  "The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renown'd,
  "But such as at this day, to Indians known,
  "In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms
  "Branching so broad and long, that in the ground
  "The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow
  "About the mother tree, a pillar'd shade
