<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">poor heart was sad; so at the Moon
  I gazed and sighed, and sighed; for ah how soon
  Eve saddens into night! mine eyes perused
  With tearful vacancy the dampy grass
  That wept and glitter'd in the paly ray
  And I did pause me on my lonely way
  And mused me on the wretched ones that pass
  O'er the bleak heath of sorrow. But alas!
  Most of myself I thought! when it befel,
  That the soothe spirit of the breezy wood
  Breath'd in mine ear: "All this is very well,
  But much of one thing, is for no thing good."
  Oh my poor heart's inexplicable swell!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
