   He stood alone; a minute's space I guess,
   I watch'd him, he continuing motionless
   To the Pool's further margin then I drew;
   He being all the while before me full in view."</p></blockquote><p>Compare this with the repetition of the same image, the next stanza but two.</p><blockquote><p>  "And, still as I drew near with gentle pace,
   Beside the little pond or moorish flood
   Motionless as a Cloud the Old Man stood,
   That heareth not the loud winds when they call;
   And moveth altogether, if it move at all."</p></blockquote></div> </div>
