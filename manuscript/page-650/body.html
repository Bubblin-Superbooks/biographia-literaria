   Hence, in a season of calm weather,
   Though inland far we be,
   Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea
   Which brought us hither;
   Can in a moment travel thither,â€”
   And see the children sport upon the shore,
   And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore."</p></blockquote><p>And since it would be unfair to conclude with an extract, which, though highly characteristic, must yet, from the nature of the thoughts and the subject, be interesting or perhaps intelligible, to but a limited number of readers; I will add, from the poet's last published work, a passage equally Wordsworthian; of the beauty of which, and of the imaginative power displayed therein, there can be but one opinion, and one feeling.
