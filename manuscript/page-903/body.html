  Blessed; for she shelter'd him
  From the damp and chilling air;
  Blessed, blessed! for she lay
  With such a babe in one blest bed,
  Close as babes and mothers lie!
  Blessed, blessed evermore,
  With her virgin lips she kiss'd,
  With her arms, and to her breast
  She embraced the babe divine,
  Her babe divine the virgin mother!

  A mortal, that can sing her praise.
  Mighty mother, virgin pure,
  In the darkness and the night
  For us she bore the heavenly Lord!</p></blockquote><p>Most interesting is it to consider the effect, when the feelings are wrought above the natural pitch by the belief of something mysterious, while all the images are purely natural.
