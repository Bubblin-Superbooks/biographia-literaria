  Perennially—beneath whose sable roof
  Of boughs, as if for festal purpose, decked
  With unrejoicing berries—ghostly shapes
  May meet at noontide; FEAR and trembling HOPE,
  SILENCE and FORESIGHT; DEATH, the Skeleton,
  And TIME, the Shadow; there to celebrate,
  As in a natural temple scattered o'er
  With altars undisturbed of mossy stone,
  United worship; or in mute repose
  To lie, and listen to the mountain flood
  Murmuring from Glazamara's inmost caves."</p></blockquote><p>The effect of the old man's figure in the poem of RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE, vol. II. page 33.</p><blockquote class="  "><p> </blockquote></div> </div>
